# Lab Website

This repository contains the source for our lab's website. The site is designed to be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and provides a simple multi-page layout with navigation links.

## Structure

- `index.html` – landing page with links to other sections
- `about.html` – brief overview of the lab
- `research.html` – placeholder for projects and publications
- `contact.html` – contact information
- `css/style.css` – basic styles shared by all pages

To view the site locally, open `index.html` in a web browser. Once pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Pages will publish it automatically.
